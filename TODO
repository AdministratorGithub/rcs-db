 REMOVE 2dsphere before releasing on mongodb 2.2.x
#####################################################

TODO 9.0.0

  RIGHT BEFORE RELEASE:
    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows
    remove the 'return' from rebuild_summary

    --

  FIX:
    check "end of file reaced" from mongoid
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries
    check threads waiting on queued collection: alert, push  (topac)
    support for "outlook" type / "gmail" and "outlook" goes into "mail" (topac)


  IMPLEMENT:
    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      automatic entities from "very" most contacted

    export intellingece data (topac)
      entities data
      graph data

    refactor export evidence with the new erb schema

    aggregation for URL
      aggregate on domain only (think if the pages have to be saved in the "info" field")
      manual creation of entities of type "virtual place" (site url)
      use the handles of "virtual place" to add urls to it
      link targets to "virtual place" if the target visits that url (complete url with page)


    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process
      - xml export
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)


  TEST:
    migration of mongo 2.4 on real data (copy db from castore to vm and try)
    flow integration with console
    export entity from console


======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
