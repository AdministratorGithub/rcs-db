TODO 9.0.0

    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows

    upgrade to mongodb 2.4.x (write the upgrade procedure during NSIS installer)
      - running 2.2
      - issue sh.stopBalancer()
      - kill mongos

    --

    add 'handle' field into addressbook

    Batch:
      - identity relation if two entities have the same handles


    aggregates for places (positioner algorithm)

    create entity form most_contacted
    associate entity from most_contacted

    flows:

      - call

     export entities data

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:
        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
