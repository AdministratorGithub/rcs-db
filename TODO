      - running 2.2
      - stop all rcs services
      - issue sh.stopBalancer() to mongos
      - kill only mongos

    accounts from outbound/inbound messages

    Batch:
      - identity relation if two entities have the same handles


    hash index for sharding

    aggregates for places (positioner algorithm)

    flows:
      - message
      - call

     export entities data
     export graph data

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:

        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)

======================================

    Refactoring on rest methods:

      - evidence (too much logic here)
