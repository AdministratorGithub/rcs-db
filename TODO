HIGH PRIORITY:

    sync / async file transfers !!!  (daniele)
        - even from the public on the collector

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)
        - mongos should be accessible by all the workers (alor)
        - modify the NSIS to install the worker together with the shards (alor)

    connect the build process with tasks (daniele)

    Local Exploit portal (alor)

    evidence grid methods

    remove objects that references an item on deletion (rules, alerts, dashboard, recent)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the worker decoding (daniele)

    hook points?

    rename proxy -> injector

    Alerting daemon

    Blotter (browsing like console)

    export logs

LOW PRIORITY:

    get time via http (collector)

    dongle dll 

    rubyencoder for 1.9.3 does NOT exist yet... :(

    mongo authentication

    443 is the default port

    regsrv32 capicom.dll  (or run ruby as system)

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks

    forwarding hooks
