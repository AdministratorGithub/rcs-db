TEST:
    performance

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    proxy rules pushing

HIGH PRIORITY:

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)

    modify the NSIS to install the worker together with the shards (alor)
    modify the registry of the service upon CN configuration

    evidence grid methods

    to_json is INSANELY SLOW

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the worker decoding (daniele)
	- audio
	- geolocation

    rename proxy -> injector

    get_accessible should be faster

    Crawler for geo
    
    Alerting daemon (worker)

    Forwarder (worker)

    Blotter (browsing like console)
    export logs

    default keystore for android & applet

LOW PRIORITY:

    get time via http (collector)

    dongle dll (naga)

    rubyencoder for 1.9.3 does NOT exist yet... :(

    mongo authentication

    regsrv32 capicom.dll  (or run ruby as system)

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
