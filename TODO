TODO 9.0.0

    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows

    --

  FIX:
    check "end of file reaced" from mongoid
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries
    check threads waiting on queued collection: alert, push  (topac)

  IMPLEMENT:
    aggregates for places (alor)
      - make the aggregator for position a single process on different shards
      - integration test with multi-day data

    report agg and int status in heartbeat

    api for console to display communication flows (message, call, chat) (topac)

    automatic entities from "very" most contacted (statistics)

    export entities data
    export graph data

    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process
      - xml export
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)



======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)


======================================
IDEAS:
