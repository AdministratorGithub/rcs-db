TODO 8.4.0

  refactor export evidence with the new erb schema

  bug privilegi (?):
    - castore: a volte non salva subito i nuovi privilegi
  TEST:
    migration of mongo 2.4 on real data (copy db from castore to vm and try) [OK]
    export entity from console

  [OK] If a person entity is created with an handle-like name (ex: wxa_d231231), wait for an adressbook ev. and 
  update its name with human readable one.

  destroy connector when item is destroyed
  conservative behaviour

  Analyze twit content to discover recipients (@-prefixed words)

TODO 9.0.0

  FIX:
    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries

  IMPLEMENT:
    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      automatic entities from "very" most contacted

    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process
      - xml export
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

    entities in the recent item list (must modify the structure of recents)

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)
    tailable cursor on get_queue instead of busy loop with sleep

  TEST:
    flow integration with console

  MIGRATION:
    and migrate old position to the new 2dsphere index


======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)
