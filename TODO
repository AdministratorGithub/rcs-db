TODO 8.3.0:

    why ruby-p286 is so slow? (mongo ruby driver?) (only on win2003?)

    failed backup (mongodump 2.2 error look for fix from mongo)

    resolve position!!!

    stop translate service during upgrade NSIS

    target profiles

    entities:
      - manual (confirmed)

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:

        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        chat peer not as string but array
        target records (schedario)
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
        inter-target query

======================================

    mongo authentication

    upgrade to mongoid 3.0.x

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
      - factory (direct mongo query)
      - operation (direct mongo query)
      - search (direct mongo query)
      - target (direct mongo query, move has too much logic)
