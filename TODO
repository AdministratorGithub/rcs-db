 REMOVE 2dsphere before releasing on mongodb 2.2.x
#####################################################

TODO 9.0.0

  RIGHT BEFORE RELEASE:
    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows
    [ok] remove the 'return' from rebuild_summary (now depends on mongoDB version)

    --

  FIX:
    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries


  IMPLEMENT:
    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      automatic entities from "very" most contacted

    export intellingece data (topac)
      [ok] entities data
      [ok] graph data (using graphml: http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html)

    refactor export evidence with the new erb schema

    aggregation for URL
      [ok] aggregate on domain only (think if the pages have to be saved in the "info" field")
      [ok] manual creation of entities of type "virtual place" (site url)
      [ok] use the handles of "virtual place" to add urls to it
      [ok] link targets to "virtual place" if the target visits that url (complete url with page)


    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process
      - xml export
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)

  MIGRATION:
    change all the aggregates of [:gmail, :mail] to :mail
    rebuild all the summaries
    change all the handles of :gmail to :mail

  TEST:
    migration of mongo 2.4 on real data (copy db from castore to vm and try)
    flow integration with console
    export entity from console


======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
