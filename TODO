TEST:
    performance
        to_json is INSANELY SLOW

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    injector rules pushing

HIGH PRIORITY:

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)
    	- geolocation (the resolution is already on REST on the db)

    default keystore for android & applet & symbian  (alor)

    default upload on new instances

    check the TODOs in the code...

    ask for confirmation (data deletion) on uninstall (alor)


MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the audio decoding (daniele)

    anonymizer configuration

    get_accessible should be faster

    Forwarder (worker)

    export logs: all, blotter, with filters, filesystem...

LOW PRIORITY:

    FFI per dongle dll

    sms wap send

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
