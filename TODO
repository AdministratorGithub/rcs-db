TODO 9.2.x

  investigate .net installation... does it require reboot?

  TRY:
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

    improve worker and evidence_transfer speed (measure and optimize)

  IMPLEMENT:

    export to connector [OK]

    scout++ (with simplified config)

    create as target (from automatic entities)

    ability to group entities together (better visualization) [OK]
      - new entity type: :group [OK]
      - the group contains a list of entities [OK]
      - the rendering of the links is demanded to the console (underlying links are created normally)

    bakcup for the handlebook
      - rebuild the handlebook after restoring a target backup [OK]

    intra operation correlation (visualize like a link to a group that actually is the other operation) [OK]

    method to create a graph representation of our data (xml, graphml, etc)
      - this will be useful for testing new visualizazion libraries on the same dataset [OK]

    automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)

    worker routing (alor)
      - db rest method for routing (coordinate with carrier) [ok]
      - rest method in workers to accept evidence [in progress]
      - install a mongo router for each shard
        - all ruby services (WAIO) talk with the local mongo router
      - tag sharding for the evidence queue (each worker keeps the quque local)

  IDEAS:
    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

    RUBY 2.0.0 ON WINDOWS depends on this:
      - http_parsers 0.5.3 needs this file https://github.com/johanneswuerbach/http_parser.rb_2.0_precompiled
      - check if new version has it
      - check that websocket dependencies have the correct version

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
