TEST:
    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

    check if after deletion the evidences (and grid) are actually deleted


TODO (daVinci 8.0.0):

    re-insert integrity for license
    license generator

    evidence for queued?

    worker decoding:
        - call
        - mic
        - mail
	    - addressbook
	    - filesystem
	        - cut del sottoalbero
	        - sub \\ con \  (anche in migrazione)
	        - usiamo anche file per il filesystem?
	    - location ?

    worker should delete evidence of deleted agents

    migration: 
       - calendar (split body in location, recipients and body)

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?



FUTURE (daVinci 8.x.x):
