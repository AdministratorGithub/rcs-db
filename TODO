TEST:
    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

    check if after deletion the evidences (and grid) are actually deleted


TODO (daVinci 8.0.0):

    speed up evidence deletion

    worker decoding:
        - mail
	    - sms/mms
        - addressbook (split fields)

    migration: 
       - calendar (split body in location, recipients and body)
       - addressbook (split fields)

    is vcredist needed ?


FUTURE (daVinci 8.x.x):

    mongo authentication

    with mongo 2.1.x
        logRotate
        mongos --install (windows service)

    upgrade for nia
