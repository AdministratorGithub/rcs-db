TODO: 9.3.0

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

    RUBY 2.0.0 ON WINDOWS depends on this:
      - http_parsers 0.5.3 needs this file https://github.com/johanneswuerbach/http_parser.rb_2.0_precompiled
      - check if new version has it
      - check that websocket dependencies have the correct version
