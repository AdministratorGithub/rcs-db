    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows

    upgrade to mongodb 2.4.x (write the upgrade procedure during NSIS installer)
      - running 2.2
      - issue sh.stopBalancer()
      - kill mongos
      - execute mongos24 --upgrade
      - issue sh.startBalancer()
      - kill all
      - copy 24 over 22
      - restart all

    upgrade RubyEncoder 1.5

    fix call forward to connectors

    accounts from outbound messages

    Realtime:

    Batch:
      - identity relation if two entities have the same handles


    hash index for sharding

    aggregates for places (positioner algorithm)

    flows:
      - message
      - call

     export entities data
     export graph data

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:
        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)

======================================

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
