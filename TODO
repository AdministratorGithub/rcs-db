TODO 9.0.0

  IMPLEMENT:

    dashboard in push mode

    scout packer

    winphone certificate

  TRY:

    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)

    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

TODO 9.1.x

  IMPLEMENT:

    scout++ (with simplified config)

    create as target (from automatic entities)

    ability to group entities together (better visualization)
      - new entity type: :group
      - the group contains a list of entities
      - the rendering of the links is demanded to the console (underlying links are created normally)

    statistic analyzer
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      [OK] frequencer for places

  IDEAS:
    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    archive of "common" criminals

    placeholder targets (linked from other operations)

    intra operation correlation (visualize like a link to a group that actually is the other operation)

    advanced multi operation search

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

    RUBY 2.0.0 ON WINDOWS depends on this:
      - http_parsers 0.5.3 needs this file https://github.com/johanneswuerbach/http_parser.rb_2.0_precompiled
      - check if new version has it
      - check that websocket dependencies have the correct version

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
