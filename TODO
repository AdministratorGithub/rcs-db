    create entity form most_contacted
    associate entity from most_contacted

    identity relation if two entities have the same handles

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:

        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)

======================================

    mongo authentication

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
      - factory (direct mongo query)
      - operation (direct mongo query)
      - search (direct mongo query)
      - target (direct mongo query, move has too much logic)
