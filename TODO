TODO 9.2.x

  investigate .net installation... does it require reboot?

  TRY:
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

  IMPLEMENT:

    export to connector [OK] (needs some config from the console...)

    scout++ (with simplified config)

    create as target (from automatic entities) [OK] (needs button in console)

    crypto-currency dissector
      - implement the evidence format
      - dissector in bdb
      - check compilation under windows

    map api request statistics

    tests for all the builds of different platforms (win, osx, android...)
      - build every kind of method (silent, scout, melted, cooked, wap, qrcode...)
      - test the upgrade process (check that files are put in queue)
      - create a new rake spec:build:all and aliases for spec:build:platform [ok]

    protect the code of the rcs-common gem (include the rgloader dir in the gem)
      - modify the rake build command

  IDEAS:
    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

    RUBY 2.0.0 ON WINDOWS depends on this:
      - http_parsers 0.5.3 needs this file https://github.com/johanneswuerbach/http_parser.rb_2.0_precompiled
      - check if new version has it
      - check that websocket dependencies have the correct version

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
