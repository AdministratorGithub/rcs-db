TEST:
    performance

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    injector rules pushing

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

    check if after deletion the evidences (and grid) are actually deleted

HIGH PRIORITY:

    deleting an agent does not delete it but mark it as deleted

    fast evidence retrieving methods

    check the TODOs in the code...

    take the hostname of the shards and not use the "auto" ip discovery

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    Forwarder (worker)

    worker decoding (daniele):
        - call
        - mic
        - calendar
        - mail
        - file

    sms wap send

    export logs: all, blotter, with filters, filesystem...

    don't send config to backdoor too old (7.x)

LOW PRIORITY:

    FFI per dongle dll

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
