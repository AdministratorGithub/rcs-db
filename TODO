TEST:
    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

    check if after deletion the evidences (and grid) are actually deleted

HIGH PRIORITY:

    crash on windows?  synchronize?

    worker decoding (daniele):
        - call
        - mic
        - mail
	    - addressbook
	    - filesystem
	        - cut del sottoalbero
	        - sub \\ con \  (anche in migrazione)
	        - usiamo anche file per il filesystem?

    worker should delete evidence of deleted agents

    link alerts to store evidence (worker)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    migration: 
       - calendar (split body in location, recipients and body)

    FFI per dongle dll

    remove the debug integrity for license

LOW PRIORITY:

    /usr/bin/mongodb --config $PATH-TO-CONFIG --shutdown

    mongo logRotate & append to log

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?


FUTURE:

    upgrade for nia

    Forwarder (worker)
