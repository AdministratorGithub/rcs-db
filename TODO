    investigate missing groups!!!

    aggregates for places (positioner algorithm)

    create entity form most_contacted
    associate entity from most_contacted

    identity relation if two entities have the same handles

    entities:
      - manual (confirmed)
      - automatic (confirmed / unconfirmed)
      - ghost (not shown)

    flows:
      - message
      - call

     export entities data

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:
        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)

======================================

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
