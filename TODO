TODO:  9.2.x

  IMPLEMENT:

    change scout name hashing for exploits using scout_version (alor & guido)

    force the NSI installer to accept only lowercase CN

    rcs-db-status utility to report:
      --monitor (the monitor section with status for each component)
      --topology (the list of anon, with name, ip, good, status)

TODO: 9.3.0

    new protocol for anonymizers (alor & fabio) (in progress)
      - NC will remain only for retro-comp and to upgrade to new anons
      - anon -> collector status reporting
      - collector -> anons configuration

    archive mode able to receive from multiple systems (topac)

    PUSH messages send the whole object (like dashboard)

    filter links by type (e.g. I want to see only skype links). We can change the format of the info attribute..

    ip sync list -> sync history with number of evidence and data size

    Use Mongodb 2.6.x

    text index may be used to index evidence's keywords (verify perf.)

    Mongoid refactoring
      - check if mongoid 4 is stable
      - migrate to mongoid 4
      - check if the connection pooling helps resolving the "get_stucked" problem

    Social Network Analisys
      - automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)
      - calculate "centrality" on entities
      - calculate "weight" on entities

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

======================================
