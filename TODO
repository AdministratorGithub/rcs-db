======================================

    mongo authentication

    upgrade to mongoid 3.0.x

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
      - factory (direct mongo query)
      - operation (direct mongo query)
      - search (direct mongo query)
      - target (direct mongo query, move has too much logic)
