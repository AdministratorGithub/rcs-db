# the idea here is to detect if the target is moving or not.
# to achieve this, we take a buffer of N element and check if they
# intersect each other. until they intersect, the target is staying in the
# same place. If a new point arrives that does not intersect, the target
# has started moving.
# we also have a filter to yield only place with a minimum time of staying
# we also detect data holes to avoid saying tha the target was staying in
# a place if we have no data
#
# every emitted Point has a starting and end time representing the time frame
# in which the target was there
