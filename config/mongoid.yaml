#
#Mongoid currently supports the following configuration options.
#
allow_dynamic_fields: false
#
#When attributes are not defined as fields but added to an object, they will get fields added for them
#dynamically and will get persisted. If set to false an error will get raised when attempting to set a value
#that has no field defined.
#
#autocreate_indexes: true
#
#When set to true Mongoid will attempt to create indexes each time a class is loaded. This is not recommended
#for any environment other than development or test.
#
#include_root_in_json: false
#
#When set to true mongoid will include the name of the root document and the name of each association as the
#root element when calling #to_json on a model.
#
max_retries_on_connection_failure: 0
#
#If you would like Mongoid to retry operations if a Mongo::ConnectionFailure occurs you may specify this option
#in your config. Mongoid will retry the operation every half second up to the limit that is set.
#This is particularly useful when using replica sets.
#
#parameterize_keys: true
#
#Tells Mongoid to convert basic special characters in composite keys to SEO friendly substrings.
#
persist_in_safe_mode: true
#
#Tells Mongoid to perform all database operations in MongoDB's safe mode. This will cause the driver to double
#check operations and raise an error if they failed. Switching to true will be safe but will be a slight performance hit.
#
raise_not_found_error: false
#
#Will raise a Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound when attempting to find a document by an id that doesnt exist.
#When set to false will only return nil for the same query.
#
#skip_version_check: false
#
#If you are having issues authenticating against MongoHQ or MongoMachine because of access to the system
#collection being not allowed, set this to true.
